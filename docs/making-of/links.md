# Feature: Links

Goal: To have bi-directional links between commit messages and published making-of pages.


## Features

- [ ] [Link from commit message to making-of page](#link-to-making-of-page)
- [ ] Link from making-of page to commit message


<a id="commit-2021-10-25-20-48"></a>

## Link to making-of page

The target address of this section should be
https://pitnyr.github.io/making-of-making-of/making-of/links.html#commit-2021-10-25-20-48

Convention: "commit-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MI"

Let's see if that works...
